## Screen

A Flutter plugin to manage the device's screen on Android and iOS.

import 'package:screen/screen.dart';

// Get the current brightness:
double brightness = await Screen.brightness;

// Set the brightness:
Screen.setBrightness(0.5);

// Check if the screen is kept on:
bool isKeptOn = await Screen.isKeptOn;

// Prevent screen from going into sleep mode:
Screen.keepOn(true);
